These files contain angular distribution data from an experiment using the ODeSA array at the University of Notre Dame in 2021. The detectors were mounted approximately 2 feet from the target and the detector diameters were 3 inches. This corresponds to a subtended angle of about 7 degrees in the laboratory frame of reference. Preliminary calculations have shown that it is important to correct for this angular resolution when fitting this data set.

Three targets were used of varying thickness. Targets 1, 7, and 10 were all 10(1) ug/cm2, while target 2 was 5.0(5) ug/cm2. Target 1's thickness was measured using a thick target yield scan of the 1.05 MeV resonance in the 13C(a,n) reaction. The corresponding energies in these files have not been corrected for average energy losses. These files currently contain data for 18 out of the 20 angles of measurement, but only the data from target 1 have been extracted from the most backward angle detectors. Hopefully I will eventually be able to get the data from the other missing detectors as well.

The file 'ND_2021_diff_ave_E.dat' contains my current full data set where the yields from different targets have been normalized to that of Target 1. Further, the beam energy has been replaced with the effective energy, which was calculated using stopping powers for carbon from SRIM and subtracting half the energy loss of the beam through the target from the original beam energy. The yield data over the narrow resonance at 1.05 MeV have been removed from this file.

The common mode systematic uncertainty for the entire data set has been estimated to be 13%. The point-to-point uncertainty has been set to 7.5% over the entire range as a reflection of yield reproducibility. This maybe a slight overestimation of the uncertainty and could be revised. The actual statistical uncertainties are much smaller, usually less than 2% uncertainty.

Further, there is unfortunately a rather large relative uncertinty in the relative efficiency of the different detectors. This has to be estimated from MCNP simulations and is still underway. Currently I estimate this as about 10%, but it really varies as a function of angle. For first fitting however, I think it makes sense to take a relative uncertainty of 10%. I still haven't figured out how to implement relative uncertainties in my analysis, I therefore take the data at one angle where the mcnp corrections are small, say 15 degrees, and give that data the systematic uncertainty. I then divide up the other data by laboratory angle and give each their own free normalization in the fit. This has been working pretty well and I usually get normalizations for these other angles of less than 10%.

As I talked about at the 2022 meeting, the large solid angle covered by the detectors requires a angular resolution correction. I'm using the angular attenuation coefficient method (Q-coefficients) of Rose. Determining these is underway, but a rough estimate that I have used is Q1 = 0.95, Q2 = 0.9, Q3 = 0.85, Q4 = 0.8. Higher order terms could also be needed but using these values resulted in a greatly improved fitting up to 3.42 MeV lab frame. However, as noted by Carl B., I was not transforming these coefficients to the CM frame, so there is yet another correction needed there.
